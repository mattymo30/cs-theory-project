# cs-theory-project
For my intriduction to Computer Science Theory course, I opted to complete a project that showcases four mathematical results that were learned. This included the following:

* Power Set Construction for Finite Automata and implementation of DFA Interpreter
* Construction of NFA From a Regular Expression
* Construction of a PDA From Context-Free Grammar and implementation of a PDA interpreter
* Implementation of a Universal Turing machine

Currently, there are four main files that implement each part of the project, with test_files for each respective portion to run examples against each result.

## Running the Project
Run one of the tests provided in the test files provided (Inside the tests folder)
For the universal Turing Machine, provide a txt file that describes a Turing Machine (examples are inside the tests folder) and run the program

## Future Work on the Project
* Implement a UI system for the Universal Turing Machine
* Implement a main file capable of running all four programs
* Creating a command-line interface for the project, with arguments to run each separate program
* (If possible) animate graphs provided, showcasing how an input traverses through a machine?
